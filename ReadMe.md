# EcoFusion: Conditional Diffusion Transformer for Synthetic GHG Emissions

## Overview
**EcoFusion** is a research-driven project that extends diffusion-transformer architectures to the sustainability domain.  
It generates **high-fidelity, context-aware synthetic greenhouse gas (GHG) emission time series**, enabling:
- Data augmentation for forecasting and anomaly detection  
- Privacy-preserving sharing of environmental data  
- Simulation of emissions under various industrial and policy conditions  

This project is inspired by the concepts introduced in *"TransFusion: Generating Long, High Fidelity Time Series using Diffusion Models with Transformers"* (Heintz et al., 2023) and extends them for environmental and sustainability applications.

## Features
- Conditional time-series generation using contextual features (temperature, production load)
- Diffusion–Transformer hybrid architecture
- Evaluation metrics for fidelity, utility, and privacy
- Realistic emission trajectory visualization
- Portable for energy, climate, and sustainability datasets

## Model Architecture
The **EcoFusion** model integrates a **transformer-based denoiser** within a **diffusion process**, conditioned on contextual embeddings.
